Last night at a bonfire somebody told me they had compiled their 100 favorite songs of 2015.  I don't think I listen to enough music to be able to make a list for just 2015 but felt that it'd be a fun exercise to do my 100 favorite songs ever.  

This list is a work in process.  At the moment it is in no particular order, nor is it necessarily even accurate.
